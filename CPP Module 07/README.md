## Templates in c++
# What Is A Template Function Or Class?
# NB: Templates are not functions. They are instructions to generate functions or classes at compile time. **This Is What A Template Is, finished**

>> EXAMPLE:
```cpp
	template <typename T>
	T	add(T a, T b) { return a + b; }
```

>> Like You Say To The Compiler Here is my instructions to create add() function.
